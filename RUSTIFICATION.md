# OPTN Rustification Architecture

## Current decision

OPTN currently uses:

- **Leptos 0.8.x** as the current Rust renderer
- **Tauri 2.x** as the current desktop/mobile shell
- **optn-core** for reusable BCH/protocol logic
- **optn-app** for framework-neutral application state and actions
- **optn-transport** for renderer-to-application communication contracts
- **optn-platform** for OS capability contracts and provider metadata

Leptos, Tauri, IPC, and individual OS integration libraries are implementation
choices, not architectural dependencies.

## Stable center

```
optn-core
    ↑
optn-app
    ↑
optn-transport ← renderer transport implementations
    ↑
renderer

optn-platform ← capability providers
```

The architecture has four independently replaceable boundaries:

1. **Renderer** — Leptos today; Slint/Dioxus/another renderer may be added later.
2. **Shell** — Tauri today; another native host may replace it.
3. **Transport** — local WASM, direct in-process Rust, Tauri IPC, or another transport.
4. **Capability provider** — pure Rust, shell plugin, direct native FFI, or browser APIs.

## Transport model

Renderers dispatch typed `AppAction` values and consume typed state/events through
`optn_transport::AppTransport`.

Current implementations:

```
Web / extension:
Leptos → LocalTransport → optn-app

Native Rust renderer:
renderer → DirectTransport → optn-runtime → optn-app

Tauri/WASM:
renderer → Tauri IPC transport (adapter boundary) → optn-runtime
```

The Tauri IPC implementation can evolve independently; the renderer must not depend
on `optn-runtime` directly.

## Capability-provider model

`optn-platform` owns capability contracts such as:

```
SecureStorage
Biometrics
QrScanner
Clipboard
Notifications
FileSystem
DeepLinks
HardwareWallet
```

Providers declare their type:

```
PureRust
Shell
NativeFfi
Web
```

The current desktop clipboard implementation is a Tauri-shell provider backed by
Rust `arboard`. Hardware HID/WebUSB providers are desktop-only and no longer enter
Android/iOS builds. Mobile-native implementations can be substituted without
changing application logic.

## Dependency rules

The following are forbidden:

```
optn-core      → Leptos/Tauri/Dioxus/Capacitor
optn-app       → Leptos/Tauri/Dioxus/Capacitor
optn-platform  → Leptos/Tauri/Dioxus/Capacitor
optn-transport → Leptos/Tauri/Dioxus/Capacitor
optn-runtime   → Leptos/Tauri/Dioxus/Capacitor
optn-ui        → optn-core directly
optn-ui        → optn-runtime directly
```

This is enforced by:

```
cargo run -p xtask -- architecture
```

## Swap examples

Renderer swap:

```
Leptos → AppTransport
becomes
Slint/Dioxus → AppTransport
```

Shell swap:

```
Tauri adapters → optn-platform / optn-transport
becomes
other shell adapters → optn-platform / optn-transport
```

Capability swap:

```
TauriBiometrics → Biometrics
becomes
AndroidNativeBiometrics → Biometrics
```

Transport swap:

```
Tauri IPC → AppTransport
becomes
DirectTransport → AppTransport
```

Wallet, transaction, crypto, protocol, and application-state logic remain unchanged.

## Migration order

1. Move trusted wallet/protocol logic into `optn-core`.
2. Move framework-neutral application state/use-cases into `optn-app`.
3. Route renderer interaction through `optn-transport`.
4. Define OS capabilities and provider metadata in `optn-platform`.
5. Keep shell/native implementations behind providers.
6. Migrate React screens to the Rust renderer incrementally.
7. Prove Tauri Android/iOS parity before removing Capacitor.
8. Prefer mature pure-Rust capability providers where they improve portability.
9. Use shell plugins or thin native FFI where pure-Rust support is not production-ready.
10. Keep web/extension on the same application/domain contracts through WASM.

## Version policy

Use current stable Rust and reviewed stable framework/tool releases. Regenerate and
verify lockfiles for dependency changes; never couple framework upgrades to unrelated
wallet behavior changes without CI evidence.
